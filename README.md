# Introduction 

This repository contains the code for deploying the landing zone components required for the Case Management Datastore (Non-Production) and Case Management Datastore (Production) subscriptions.

This will create the VNETs and the subnets, however things like VNET peering to the hub will be managed manually by CPS Cloud Ops team.

This will also create Key Vault and an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
